  Wrap this around any old element to make it nicely centered with flexbox,
  with the content appearing at the center of a 9-box grid.

  ```html
  <flex-centered>
   <span>Hi!<span>
  </flex-centered>
  ```

  Or you can just center your content in a 'row', which is a single row
  with a 3-box 'grid'.

  ```html
  <flex-centered-row>
   <span>Hi!<span>
  </flex-centered-row>
  ```
